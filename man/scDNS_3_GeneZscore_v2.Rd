\usage{
scDNS_3_GeneZscore_v2(
  scDNSobject,
  reCreatNEA = FALSE,
  PositiveGene = NULL,
  repTime = 1,
  testTime = 5,
  FDRmethods = "BH",
  corr_adjust = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scDNSobject}{A scDNS object containing the gene interaction network}

\item{reCreatNEA}{Whether to re-generate NEA models with stochastic}

\item{PositiveGene}{Optional character vector specifying a set of positive}

\item{repTime}{Number of repetitions used when creating each NEA}

\item{testTime}{Integer. Number of independent stochastic tests performed to
identify the most robust seed with the best recovery accuracy of
PositiveGene.}

\item{FDRmethods}{Character. Multiple testing correction method for p-values,
such as "BH", "BY", or "bonferroni".}

\item{corr_adjust}{Whether to apply correlation adjustment when
combining multiple Z-scores using the Stouffer method.}
}
\value{
A scDNS object with the following updated slots:
- NEAModel$ZscoreList: List of Z-score results for all NEA models
- Zscore: Data frame containing combined Z-scores, p-values, adjusted p-values, and accuracy metrics
- Network: Updated network information used for computation
}
\description{
This function calculates gene-level Z-scores from a scDNS object using
three types of null network models: random edge rewiring, label shuffling,
and random distribution.
