\title{Detect and handle duplicate edges in a network matrix or data frame.}
\usage{
detect_Duplicate_edge4net(net, ingnoreDireaction = TRUE, returnLogical = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{A two-column matrix or data frame representing edges (e.g., from-to pairs).}

\item{ingnoreDireaction}{Logical. If TRUE, edges are treated as undirected,
so (A, B) and (B, A) are considered duplicates. Default is TRUE.}

\item{returnLogical}{Logical. If TRUE, returns a logical vector where
TRUE indicates non-duplicate rows; otherwise, returns the deduplicated network.}
}
\value{
If returnLogical is TRUE, a logical vector of the same length as the number of rows in net,
with TRUE for unique (non-duplicate) edges. Otherwise, a matrix or data frame
containing only the unique edges.
}
\description{
This function identifies duplicate edges in a two-column network representation.
It can optionally treat edges as undirected (ignoring direction) and return either
a logical vector indicating non-duplicate rows or a deduplicated network.
