\title{Convert 2D subscripts (row and column indices) to linear indices.}
\usage{
sub2ind(r = 2, c = 3, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Row index (1-based).}

\item{c}{Column index (1-based).}

\item{nrow}{Number of rows in the matrix.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in the matrix (not used in computation but included for clarity).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the linear index corresponding to the given row and column.
}
\description{
This function converts matrix subscripts (row and column positions) into a single linear index,
assuming column-major order (as used in R). It is useful for indexing elements in a matrix
when working with flattened (vectorized) representations.
